This is a sample project for a three panel layout view which will slide horizontally upon the pressing of a button.
It uses the compatibility library in order to support pre-3.0 versions of Android.

Updated the project configuration.  There is now a project with just the core sliding layout classes and an alternate project built as a sample.  The sample project was built in eclipse and should run out of the box.  If it doesn't you probably just need to create the gen and bin directories.  

* SlidingLayout now supports a 2 panel sliding format when in Tablet mode
* Target SDK set to 2.2
* 'Hotspot' support when on either side panel.  The user can click anywhere on the side of the 'peeking' view to have it reveal itself.
